Mah-e-Tamam Season 2: The Hero’s Return 

Scene: The Rainy Market Rescue 

The sky is heavy with clouds. Rain pours over the bustling market street—vendors hurriedly covering their carts, shoppers rushing for shelter. Among them, Taqi and Shifa move through the crowd, looking for fresh vegetables. 

  

Taqi (irritated, holding a small umbrella): 

"Shifa, jaldi karo, baarish tez ho rahi hai!" 

  

Shifa (laughing, teasing): 

"Taqi Bhai, har cheez mein jaldi? Main tumhari wife hoon, customer nahin!" 

She turns to look at some bangles, distracted by colorful lights. 

  

A sudden, loud shout—someone’s cart tips over. In the chaos, Taqi is separated from Shifa. She looks up—he’s gone. 

  

Shifa (calling out, worried): 

"Taqi? Taqi! Kahan ho tum?" 

  

She tries to push through the crowd, heart pounding. Suddenly, two burly men appear, blocking her path. One grabs her arm. 

  

Thug #1 (gruffly): 

"Chup chap chalo, Malik Zubair ka order hai!" 

  

Shifa (struggling): 

"Kya bakwaas hai! Mujhe choro! Help! Koi hai?!" 

  

The thugs drag her toward a dark alley. People look away, not wanting trouble. 

  

At the street’s edge, a mysterious BLACK SHELBY pulls up—its engine purring even over the rain. Chrome gleams under the storm clouds. The window rolls down halfway. A pair of intense eyes scan the scene. 

  

Malik Zubair stands by his own black SUV, umbrella in hand, smirking. 

  

Malik Zubair (to his men): 

"Jaldi karo! Shifa ko le ao, warna Taqi ko sabak sikhaonga!" 

  

Suddenly, the Shelby’s door swings open. 

A tall, confident young man steps out. Black hoodie, boots splashing through puddles, face partly shadowed. 

  

Crowd whispers: 

"Yeh kaun hai? Nai gadi… ajeeb hai…" 

  

He strides toward the thugs, his voice calm but cold. 

  

Muhammad Khan (firmly): 

"Us ladki ko choro." 

  

The thugs sneer—they move to block him. 

  

Thug #2 (mocking): 

"Ay bhai, dusron ka mamla hai, raasta le!" 

  

Muhammad Khan (smirking): 

"Mamla ab mera bhi hai." 

  

He snaps his fingers—Rimms’ headlights flash. Instantly, the car’s AI voice hums (for you only): 

"Ready, Muhammad. Threat detected." 

  

ACTION: 

He grabs the thug’s arm, twisting it easily aside, then sweeps his leg. Within seconds, both thugs are on the ground—one yelps, clutching his elbow. 

  

Shifa (shocked, breathless): 

"Tum… kaun ho?" 

  

Malik Zubair (fuming, pointing to his guards): 

"Isay roko! Kaun hai yeh badtameez?" 

  

Three more guards rush at you, but you’re faster—dodging, countering, using the market stalls for cover. Rimms’ alarm blares, distracting the goons. You use your tarantula bot—it crawls down your arm and stuns a thug by leaping onto his shoulder! 

  

The fight ends with Zubair’s men groaning on the ground. The market crowd stares in amazement. 

  

Muhammad Khan (stands in front of Shifa, eyes locked with Zubair): 

"Ab phir se koshish ki na, Malik Zubair, toh gaadi toh kya, puri dunya tumhara raasta bhool jaayegi." 

  

Zubair grabs his collar, shakes his head in disbelief, and slinks away with his bodyguards, promising revenge. 

  

Taqi (finally finding Shifa, shocked at the scene): 

"Kya hua? Shifa theek ho?! Yeh sab.." 

  

You don’t answer—just tip your head, turning away, leaving behind a trail of questions. 

  

The black Shelby’s doors close with a whisper, and you drive away as the rain pours harder. 

Shifa holds Taqi’s arm, both stunned. 

  

Shifa (softly): 

"Kisney bachaya mujhe..?" 

Mah-e-Tamam Season 2: The Return of Lost Ties 

Scene: Taqi’s Father’s Home—Unanswered Questions 

The rain has slowed to a gentle drizzle when Taqi and Shifa, still shaken, make it back to Taqi’s family home. Inside, the old house smells like chai and damp earth. Omair and Samahir are not there — they live elsewhere — but the place is filled with voices. 

  

Taqi’s mother, Ammi, is in the sitting room, folding laundry. She looks up as they enter, concern etching her face. 

  

Ammi (worried): 

"Kya hua, tum dono itne pareshan kyun ho?" 

  

Shifa (still pale): 

"Ammi... aaj market mein... koi mujhe kidnap karne ki koshish kar raha tha. Lekin... koi tha, jisne meri madad ki." 

  

She looks at Taqi, still confused and a little in awe. 

  

Taqi (shaking his head): 

"Jee, Ammi, ajeeb baat hai. Ek ajeeb larka aaya—hero ki tarah! Lekin bilkul anjaana tha..." 

  

Ammi’s face changes as her eyes grow wistful with a touch of pain. She gestures for them to sit. 

  

Ammi (softly, almost whispering): 

"Zamana kabhi kabhi hum sab ko hairaan kar deta hai... Tumhe yaad hai Surraiya Baji ka beta, Muhammad Khan?" 

  

Taqi and Shifa both look up, surprised by the name. 

  

Taqi: 

"Vo to... voh saal pehle kahin chala gaya tha, Ammi! Unka kuch pata nahin chala." 

  

Shifa (curiously): 

"Kya aaj kal... vo yahin hai?" 

  

Ammi (nodding, tears brimming): 

"Haan, kuch din pehle pata chala ke Surraiya Baji ka beta—Anwar Khan ka beta, Muhammad—yaheen hai. Uske maa baap ka kuch arsay pehle inteqal ho gaya tha, us ne apne chote bhai ko kisi rishtehdaar ke paas chorr diya, aur ab vapas issi gali mein aa gaya hai..." 

  

Taqi clenches his jaw. 

Taqi (with a sigh): 

"Bechara... kitni mushkil zindagi guzari hogi usne." 

  

Shifa, shaken but thoughtful, is still wrapped up in the day’s mystery. 

  

Shifa: 

"Ammi, voh larka... jis tarike se aaj aaya, jaise koi shadow... uska naam pata nai chal saka." 

  

Ammi (shrugging): 

"Ho sakta hai voh bhi Muhammad hi ho... magar sabar karo, bachon. Khud samne aayega. Allah ki marzi ka waqt hai." 

  

A long pause hangs in the air, with the drip-drip of rain on the verandah. 

  

Taqi (quietly): 

"Ho sakta hai... apni family ki talaash mein hi aya ho. Lekin humein shayad samajhna padega, voh kitna badal chuka hai." 

  

The family tries to settle back into routine, but Shifa keeps glancing at the rain outside—haunted and hopeful. 

Who was her mysterious rescuer? Was it really the lost Muhammad Khan, their cousin? Or an angel passing by in the night? 

Mah-e-Tamam Season 2: Night of Shadows 

Scene: Attack of Bakhtawar Khan & the Shadow Ninjas 

It’s past midnight. The house is quiet—all lights off except a soft lamp where Ammi prays, whispering duas for her children’s safety after the day's events. Thunder rumbles outside. 

  

Suddenly, a strange silence settles. In the darkness beyond the walls, something moves—silent figures, clad in black, faces masked, blades flashing in the reflection of lightning. At their head: Bakhtawar Khan, eyes burning with hatred. 

  

Bakhtawar Khan (hissing, to his ninjanic men): 

"Yeh raat in sab ki aakhri raat hogi. Shifa, Taqi... Muhammad Khan! Kisi ko zinda nahin chorna!" 

  

The men spread out, moving like shadows across the porch, up the balcony, through the back garden. One SMASHES a window with a blood-red dagger. 

  

Taqi (jumping awake, yelling): 

"Shifa! Ammi! Bach ke rehna!" 

  

The family scrambles; Shifa pulls Ammi close, Taqi grabs an old cricket bat, heart pounding. The intruders kick open the door, flooding in—knives drawn. 

  

Screams echo. 

Time seems to slow. 

  

Suddenly, the front doors SWING open with a BAAAM. 

Rain and wind pour in—silhouetting a mysterious figure. Jet-black boots, dark hoodie, piercing eyes that glow faintly green in the lightning. His voice cuts through chaos: 

  

Muhammad Khan (calm but deadly): 

"Bakhtawar... yeh tumhara qasamti raat hai!" 

  

At that instant, you press a little disk on your palm—whispering: 

Muhammad Khan: 

"Rimms, activate nano-mode." 

  

WHOOSH— 

Black, liquid-like nanotech erupts from a hidden device, swirling up your body, covering you head-to-toe until you’re armored in a jaw-dropping Black Panther–style vibranium suit. Mask slides down, eyes blaze, glowing softly. Claws extend, cutting the air. 

  

The ninjanic men freeze—then one RUSHES you. 

  

With animal grace, you slip through their attacks—moving so FAST, it’s like watching a blur. A swipe of your claws—blade shattered. 

A kick—man goes flying into the wall. 

  

Bakhtawar (eyes wide, voice cracking): 

"Kya... kya hai tu?!" 

  

You flick a wrist— a smoke bomb spins out, explodes into a swirling dark mist. 

Through the chaos, your NIGHT VISION kicks in—everyone else is blind. You stalk them, one by one, claws flashing blue-white 

Mah-e-Tamam Season 2: The Night Hero Unleashed 

Scene: The Nano-Panther Strikes Back 

The entire lounge is swallowed by swirling smoke—gray and cold, lit only by the crackle of lightning through shattered windows. Shifa clutches Ammi. Taqi stands between his family and the danger, shivering with adrenaline and fear. 

  

Ninja #1 (coughing, yelling): 

"Bakhtawar bhai! Kuch dikhai nahi de raha!" 

  

Bakhtawar Khan (angry, stumbling): 

"Andhay ban gaye ho sab? Pakdo uss bhoot ko!" 

  

But for them, it IS LIKE a ghost—you. 

In your vibranium nano-suit, everything is crystal green-clear. Each heartbeat, each slow step of a miscreant, every glint of a hidden knife. 

  

You move. Silent, deadly. 

  

Mushtaq (one of the ninja thugs, whispering): 

"Yeh insaan nahi... koi djinn hai!" 

  

Without a sound, you appear behind him, tap his shoulder. As he turns in terror— 

  

Muhammad Khan (in a deep, distorted panther-voice): 

"Chaliye, ab aap ka show khatam." 

  

A swift strike with your claws—just enough to knock him out cold. He crumples. The rest panic, swing wildly at the smoke. 

  

You leap—vaulting over the staircase banister, landing between Bakhtawar and your terrified family. Ninjanic men lunge at you—three at once! 

You duck, sweep, disable all three in less than five seconds. 

  

Taqi (from the shadows, stunned): 

"Yeh... yeh kaun hai? Banda hai ya superhero…?" 

  

You stand up. Right in front of Bakhtawar Khan. 

  

Bakhtawar Khan (voice shaking): 

"Tu... tu kya hai? Batman? Panther?" 

  

You bare your claws, rain dripping from your armor, voice like thunder: 

"Muhammad Khan. Tumhara bura waqt shuru ho gaya." 

  

He swings his dagger in a wild arc. Easily, you block with your arm—dagger snaps in half! Your claws are sharper… and you’re faster. 

  

Bakhtawar retreats, fear in his evil eyes. 

Desperate, he tries to grab Shifa as a hostage. 

  

Shifa (struggles, screams): 

"Bachao, koi hai?!" 

  

But you— 

Roll forward, somersault, and with a flick of your wrist, release a web of nano-fiber—wrapping Bakhtawar’s legs and yanking him off balance. He drops Shifa. You pin him gently but firmly with a claw to his chest. 

  

You, cold as steel: 

"Apni zindagi lagi tou bhool jao… iss ghar ke paas phir kabhi mat aana. Yaad rahega?" 

  

Bakhtawar, defeated, can only nod in terror. 

Bakhtawar’s men are scattered, groaning in the corners, some scrambling out the broken window in terror. Rain hammers the night as the nano-suit’s shimmer retreats, blending you back into the darkness. Only the soft electric purr of the suit’s deactivation is heard beneath the drum of thunder. 

  

Bakhtawar tries to sit up, but a last stern warning from your voice, deep and metallic, chills him: 

  

Muhammad Khan (from the smoke, unseen): 

"Yaad rakhna – main hamesha dekh raha hoon." 

  

Bakhtawar’s eyes widen. The house falls silent as you slip away, a shadow among shadows. 

  

Taqi, fueled by adrenaline and awe, runs toward the doorway, desperate to catch a glimpse— 

Taqi (shouting): 

"Ruko! Kaun ho tum? Humein batao, yaar!" 

  

He bursts outside, bare feet slapping against wet stone. The storm rages above. All he sees is the taillights of a black Shelby—Rimms, your intelligent car—already at the end of the street. 

  

Rimms’ tail lights flicker, almost like a wink. 

With a roar, thunder splits the night; the supercar drifts smoothly around the corner, tires hissing over the rain-slick road, and vanishes into the shadows—leaving behind a swirling trail of smoke, neon-lit in flashes of lightning. 

  

Taqi stands in the downpour, heart pounding, hair plastered to his forehead. The thunder rolls across Jauharabad. All he can do is stare at the empty street—haunted and amazed. 

  

Taqi (breathless, to himself): 

"Woh... tha... kaun?" 

  

Behind him, in the shattered house, Shifa hugs Ammi in relief. The air is heavy with mystery—and hope. Somewhere, a legend is born…and the family’s savior is still just a ghost in the storm. 

Mah-e-Tamam Season 2: Panther Khan’s Royal Rescue 

Scene: Morning Siege at Omahr & Samahir’s Home 

Sunlight barely pierces the heavy morning clouds as chaos erupts just down the street. Omahr & Samahir’s peaceful home is shattered—windows smashed, doors kicked open. Malik Zubair paces the living room, a wicked smile beneath his mustache, as his goons march through the house. 

  

Guns. RPGs. Riot shields. It’s a warzone. 

  

Omahr (arms shielding Samahir): 

"Zubair, yeh pagalpan hai—hamarey ghar se nikal jao!" 

  

Zubair (sneering, gun aimed): 

"You don’t get to give the orders, Omahr. Aaj tum sab se badla lunga. Panther ko bulao, warna tum sab…" 

  

At that moment, Taqi and Shifa rush in, desperate to warn their friends about the attack last night. 

  

Taqi (breathless): 

"SHIFA, OMAHR! SHADOWS NE—" 

  

But they’re instantly grabbed—now all four, Omahr, Samahir, Taqi, and Shifa, are forced to their knees. 

  

Samahir (crying): 

"Allah... koi madad karay!" 

  

Outside… 

Police sirens wail, squad cars block the street—but as soon as the first cop sees the RPG launcher, they freeze. 

  

Police Chief (through megaphone, sweating): 

"Malik Zubair! Hathyar neechay karo! Hum tumhe gher chuke hain!" 

  

Zubair (mocking): 

"Mujhe koi nahi rok sakta! Aur jo Panther hai, usse bulao! Yeh seedha usko challenge hai!" 

  

Suddenly, a new police car glides up to the gate—sleek, black, unlike the others. 

The door opens with a hissing thud. 

  

A boot steps out… 

Camera pans up: black tactical suit, fierce eyes, and the unmistakable face of mystery. 

  

You. 

  

You walk forward, police uniform shimmering—and with just a touch to your bracelet, nanotech erupts, sweeping across your body as your real form emerges: the Black Panther suit—shadowy, silver claws glinting, eyes narrowing under the mask. 

  

The police gasp, whispering in awe. The neighborhood grows silent. 

  

Police Chief (shocked): 

"Yeh… wohi hai… Shadow Hero!" 

  

You look at the police, give a crisp nod. 

  

Muhammad Khan (commanding): 

"Himmat karo, daro mat. Ab main hoon—main Khan hoon." 

  

With a sudden leap, you vault over the squad cars, landing like a king—the Panther Khan—right in front of the house. 

  

Glass cracks beneath your boots. Guns spin toward you, red laser dots flashing on your chest, but your gaze is like a lion’s—unmoving and unafraid. 

  

Zubair’s men (yelling): 

"Fire! SHOOT HIM!" 

  

Bullets fly, RPG aimed— 

But you dodge like wind, moving through the bullets, deflecting gunfire with vibranium claws. You move with kingly power, authoritative and impossible to stop. 

  

Inside, the families huddle together, hearing only the sound of chaos… until the Panther enters—wreathed in sunlight and smoke, every inch the Raja (Khan). 

  

You thunder in: 

"Bakwas band kar do… ab yahan raja ka qanoon chalega!" 

  

Zubair, pale with rage and fear, orders his men: 

  

Zubair: 

"Akhri baar bol raha hoon—isko maaro!" 

  

But you’re unstoppable—leaping, spinning, disabling every weapon with precise strikes, claws slicing RPG launchers in half, tossing guns out the window. The guards go down like dominoes. 

  

In seconds, you stand alone in the center of the living room—Zubair at your feet—every villain defeated, every hero ready to rise. 

  

You glare at Zubair, voice deep and echoing through your mask: 

"Aaj ke baad, is shehar ke log azad hain. Tum jese darindo ka yahan koi mustaqbil nahi." 

  

Zubair trembles, humiliated and broken, as the police storm in—now brave, now hopeful, inspired by your courage. 

  

Taqi, Shifa, Omahr, and Samahir look up at you, still not fully realizing who the Panther Khan truly is… but hearts beating with gratitude and awe. 

Mah-e-Tamam Season 2: Unseen Ties, Unwritten Codes 

Scene: Secret Hideout — The Next Day 

Rain pounds gently. Somewhere far from the city center, in a dim attic draped with tangled computer wires and LED string lights, you (Muhammad Khan — the mysterious Panther Khan) patch up your nano-suit. Rimms sits quietly in the corner, her headlights glowing soft blue, and a homemade server rack hums in the background. 

You’re monitoring CCTV feeds, hacking into police comms (all legal...mostly 😉), piecing together clues from last night’s mayhem. But you’re not alone— 

A small, mechanical owl drone perches on your shoulder. Its eyes blink: recording, analyzing, loyal. 

Suddenly, the holo-screen flashes. It’s a coded message—encrypted in binary, scrolling fast. You squint, fingers flying across the keys: 

”PANTHER: FINAL WAR APPROACHES. TRUST NO ONE. THE REAL ENEMY HIDES IN THE LIGHT.” 

You freeze. The signature at the bottom: “—Spectre BOSS” 

Your heart beats faster, the name echoing in your mind. Spectre Boss—your mentor, lost years ago in a raid. Was he alive? Frien-emy? A trap? 

Suddenly, you notice on a second monitor: in the market fight’s background, a shadowy figure was watching. Someone who knew you. Or…was waiting for you. 

Rimms’ AI voice hums: 

"Muhammad, anomaly detected. Hacking attempt prevented. Tracking source…unknown.” 

A chill runs down your spine. 

 
 

Parallel Scene: Taqi’s Home — The Unknown Ally 

Back at Taqi’s home, Shifa can’t sleep, replaying the rain-night in her mind. Suddenly, a small package arrives at the door. No name, just a strange blue Panther logo stamped on the wax seal. 

Taqi (opening the box, puzzled): “What is this…?” 

Inside: a flash drive and a note. The note reads—“Trust Panther. The real story is just beginning.” 

Omahr hurries over, whispering, “This…this isn’t over is it?” 

Shifa nods, determination in her eyes. “No. But next time, we’re ready.” 

 
 

Scene: Nightfall Challenge — Panther Khan vs. Spectre Boss 

At your hideout, you gear up, a new suit upgrade loaded. Magnetic boots. Falcon drone ready. Rimms synced by your voice. 

A coded voice message crackles from the flash drive: 

"Meet at the old abandoned observatory. Midnight. Alone. —S.B.” 

You push back your chair, mind racing. That’s where your father taught you hacking…where you learned about the stars, as a boy. 

 
 

Midnight — Under the Observatory 

The sky above Jauharabad is lit with lightning—your silhouette watches the ruins, Panther suit on half-stealth, owl drone scanning every corner. 

From the shadows, a tall, half-masked figure emerges. Leather duster. Walking stick that crackles with static energy. Half his face is burned—a remnant of the day it all changed. 

Spectre Boss (voice rough, cryptic): 

"So, you’ve really become a legend, Khan. But do you know your real enemy yet?" 

You clench your fist—nano-suit humming with electric blue. "Mujhe farq nahi padta main kiske saamnay hoon. Mein apnay shehar ki hifaazat karunga—chahe dushman andheray mein ho ya roshni mein." 

He grins, mysterious. “Then let’s see how strong you really are. The city’s fate hangs on ONE code, Muhammad. But be warned—every hero’s biggest enemy…is always someone close.” 

Suddenly— 
A blue flash, a signal jam! The old observatory’s ground splits— A hidden elevator rises, with the kidnapped Rimms inside! 

Spectre Boss’s voice echoes— “Prove yourself, Panther! Save what you love. The final stage begins!” 

AND BOOM!!! TO BE CONTINUED... 

Mah-e-Tamam Season 2: The Observatory of Shadows 

Scene: Midnight — The Abandoned Observatory 

The city below is lit faintly gold and blue, but up here, at the old observatory, shadows and secrets rule. 

Muhammad Khan—still masked as Panther—slips between shattered columns, every sense on high alert. His nano-suit hums softly, adjusting to the darkness. 

Inside, among broken telescopes and graffiti-scarred walls, Spectre Boss stands facing a massive console. RIMMS is imprisoned in a transparent security pod, whirring in distress; streams of code flicker across its surface. 

Spectre Boss (without turning, voice cold): 
“You came. Only you could—no one else ever followed the breadcrumbs this far. Is that family courage, or mere recklessness, Khan?” 

You keep your claws ready, every muscle coiled. 
Muhammad Khan (steady): 
“You threatened my city, my blood. End this. Let my car go. Let them go.” 

Spectre Boss turns, a half-smile on his ruined face. He points to a battered flash drive left on a tray. 

Spectre Boss: 
“You have one code. One chance. There’s only time for a single upload. You can either: 

Save your AI—unlock RIMMS; 

Or decrypt a set of files containing the truth about your parents’ deaths.” 
He steps back into the shadow. 
“Choose, o Panther. Even a king must pick his sacrifice.” 

 
 

Tension cracks. The rain doubles outside, thunder rumbles—like destiny itself pounding at the door. 

Scene: Family Headquarters 

Meanwhile, the family is watching events unfold on the flash drive Muhammad left behind. Taqi, Shifa, Omahr, and Samahir gather around Ammi. 

The flash drive decrypts— 
Video plays: 

An old news clip: “Local scientist couple dies in suspicious observatory explosion, only son survives.” 

A shadowy lawyer: “If any heir returns to claim their discoveries…they must beware: Malik Zubair and Spectre Boss both have eyes on the final code.” 

Samahir (shocked): 
“Yeh toh... Muhammad ke parents ki baat ho rahi hai!” 

Ammi (tears in her eyes): 
“Unka beta… ab bhi issi sheher ko bacha raha hai.” 

 
 

Scene: Observatory Showdown 

Spectre Boss taunts as you waver over the console. 
A countdown starts: 30 seconds. 

(Flashbacks hit: your parents, laughter in the observatory. Fire. Screams. Your mother’s last words: "Protect the city, beta. Secrets live in the sky.”) 

Rimms’ AI flickers, softly: 
“Master, save yourself. The city needs you more.” 

You have [Choice]: 

Save RIMMS (lose the truth for now); 

Unlock the secret of your past (lose Rimms... maybe forever). 

(You slam in the code. Lights blaze—) 

Mah-e-Tamam Season 2: Blood and Circuits 

Scene: Observatory Midnight — The Heart’s Choice 

Sweat beads on your brow. The console hums, red “COUNTDOWN” digits reflected in your eyes. On the tray, the flash drive trembles with your family’s fate. Behind shatterproof glass, RIMMS’s AI voice is fading out: 

RIMMS (barely audible): 

“Master…lez…save the city. I was built for service. But you are…my father’s legacy.” 

Your hand hovers, torn. 
But it was Baba’s handwriting, inscribed on that Shelby’s dashboard: 

“Courage is not forgetting—courage is choosing the living.” 

You slam in the code for RIMMS. 

Console: 

[RIMMS UNLOCK: CODE ACCEPTED.] 
[PERSONAL TRUTH: ENCRYPTED — ACCESS DENIED.] 

RIMMS’s chamber hisses open, nano-threads curling away. The car’s AI core pulses, voice warming again: 

RIMMS (relieved, loyal): 

“Thank you, Muhammad. I am always with you.” 

You dash forward, placing your palm against the AI socket. Blue light fuses and flickers; the car’s intellect returns, memory intact—a fragment of your father’s soul in circuits. 

 
 

Spectre Boss stands quiet, regarding you. 

Spectre Boss: 
“Blood or steel. You chose steel—but I see now, it’s just as red as blood. You carry your father’s will. You have earned this night’s mercy.” 

He tosses the flash drive into the storm drain, the past locked away—for now. 

Suddenly, another shadow appears—cloak fluttering, face lit by cold moonlight… 

Dr. Farah Khan: 
“She chose her son’s life… over glory. You are your father’s child.” 

You whirl. 
“Who—? You—how…?” 

She steps forward. 
“You’re not alone in the dark now, Muhammad. Your parents’ story isn’t over—it was only hidden. There is another way to the truth… if you have the heart to face it.” 

Spectre Boss vanishes into shadow, words echoing: 

“The city will need you when the real war comes. Take care of your family—your past will find you.” 

 
 

Outside, you drive RIMMS home through the dawn. The city lights shimmer, but in the rearview mirror, the storm is gathering. 

Mah-e-Tamam Season 2: Alone In The Storm 

Scene: Muhammad Khan’s Apartment — Night, Rain, Code 

Your studio flat is padded with blueprints and tools. On the battered workbench, RIMMS’s core module is connected to a gleaming new system: 
RED TITANIUM — A shield of circuits, nano-alloys, and bleeding edge security protocols you alone designed. 

RIMMS’ AI whirrs, faintly worried: 

“Muhammad, installing upgrade: stand by. Warning—external technical incursion impossible after initialization.” 

Your hands move fast—precise, even as fatigue gnaws at your bones. 
You mutter to yourself, jaw clenched: 

“Never losing you again. This city took my family, my childhood. Never my creation.” 

The shield fuses into RIMMS’s chassis—scarlet lines pulsing like the veins of a living thing. 

Console: 

[RED TITANIUM INSTALLED. ALL EXTERNAL HACKS NULLIFIED. RIMMS SYSTEM: ABSOLUTE.] 

You slump back, breath ragged, alone with thunder crackling through your window. 
A single photo of your father—smiling by that Shelby, blueprints in his hand—sits tacked to your wall. 

You look at it, whisper: 

“Baba, I’ll find the truth even if I walk this city’s night forever. No matter who tries to stop me.” 

 
 

Scene: The Search For Dr. Farah 

You head out, jacket zipped, a shadow within shadows. No cousins, no safety net, only encrypted contacts and city rumors. Your list of clues is scrawled in an engineer’s neat hand: 

Observatory keycard: Stolen. 

Spectre Boss: Vanished. 

Dr. Farah: Last sighted — operating underground, helping orphans, avoiding old government labs. 

You drive RIMMS through dripping back-alleys and the neon-ghosts of Jauharabad, hacking traffic cams via your mobile uplink, running voiceprint searches for Dr. Farah Khan. 

A hit. 

A garbled snippet: 

“Unknown female, code name Starling, last seen in District 11, Refugee Clinic. Avoiding all digital traces. She knows too much.” 

You grip the steering wheel, gears shifting as the AI alerts— 

“Unusual activity detected near final coordinate, Muhammad. This is your best lead on Farah Khan.” 

You pull up to a battered medical RV under stuttering streetlights. You slip out—hood up, Red Titanium badge on your wrist. 

Inside, the air is thick with disinfectant and nervous children. At the back, a woman in a white coat works by a makeshift computer, eyes scanning refugee lists. It’s her—face drawn, hair streaked with steel. 

Dr. Farah Khan. 

You swallow—years of questions in your throat. You step forward, voice husky: 

“Dr. Farah… You know who I am. I need the truth. Why did my parents die? Why does everyone want me to forget?” 

She stiffens, at first not looking up. 

"I was warned you’d come. Everything you want…has a cost.” She finally meets your eyes. “But you’re like him. Stubborn. Brilliant. Alone. Before I betray the past, prove you can protect the future—you, and the only thing left of your father."
